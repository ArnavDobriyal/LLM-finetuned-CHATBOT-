# AI Therapist Chatbot

## Overview

Welcome to the AI Therapist Chatbot â€“ an advanced conversational agent designed to provide empathetic and context-aware responses. Leveraging the power of GPT-2 language model fine-tuned with a carefully curated personal dataset, this chatbot goes beyond generic interactions, aiming to create meaningful and supportive conversations.

### Key Features

- **Fine-tuned Model**: Our chatbot is powered by a GPT-2 language model fine-tuned using Language Model Fine-tuning (LLM) techniques. This ensures that the bot's responses are not only accurate but also sensitive to user context.

- **Web Interface with Flask**: Interact seamlessly with the chatbot through a user-friendly web interface built using Flask. The application's intuitive design makes it easy for users to engage in conversations and receive thoughtful responses.

- **Personalized Conversations**: The chatbot has been trained on a personal dataset, allowing it to understand and respond to users with a personalized touch. This ensures that interactions are tailored to individual needs and preferences.

- **Versatile Uses**: The AI Therapist Chatbot is not limited to providing emotional support. It can be employed across various domains such as customer service, education, and general information retrieval. The adaptable nature of the model makes it suitable for diverse applications.

### Training the Model

For users interested in model training:

1. **Prepare Training Dataset:**
   - Create a CSV file with 'user_input' and 'prompt' columns.

2. **Adjust File Path:**
   - Set the file path in the training script:
     ```python
     train_therapist_model("path/to/train_dataset.csv", "output_model")
     ```

3. **Run Training Script:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   Fine-tune the model to enhance its conversational abilities.
